## Topics Covered Since Exam 1
### Chemical ecology
  * Insects rely heavily on semiochemicals to get information from the environment.
  * Insects use pheromones for intraspecific communication. There are many types of pheromones: sex pheromones, aggregation pheromones, alarm pheromones, trail-following pheromones, etc.
  * Synthetic pheromones extensively in insect pest control for monitoring, population reduction (attracticides), and mating disruption.
  * Insects use kairomones for finding food: host plants, nectar, prey and host insects.
### Mimicry and Camouflage
  * Batesian mimicry: a non-harmful species (mimic) has evolved to look like a harmful species (model)
  * Mullerian mimicry: two or more unrelated noxious, or dangerous, organisms exhibit closely similar warning coloration (usually patterns often yellow, red and black stripes)
  * Camouflage
### Population dynamics
  * Exponential model
  * Logistic model
  * Carrying capacity (k): maximum population size that can be sustained by the environment
  * r-selected and k-selected species
  * Lotka-Voltera model for population dynamics of interacting species
### Invasive species
  * An invasive species is alien and causes harm.
  * Invasive species readily establish on tropical islands because they have "escaped from natural enemies", weather is benign (no winter, high humidity), and there is usually plenty of food and water.
  * Fifty percent of Guam's invasive insects belong to Order Hemiptera.
### Applied entomology
  * Pest control based solely on pesticide application is limited because of pesticide resistance and nontarget effects.
  * Integrated pest management (IPM): one or more pest control tactics are selected based on knowledge of the current situation gained from pest monitoring.
  * IPM tactics include pesticide application, sanitation, biological control, physical control, cultural control, and "do nothing".
  * If possible, broad spectrum pesticides should be avoided because they may kill beneficial insects which will lead to an uncontrolled resurgence of pests.
