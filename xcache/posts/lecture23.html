<h4>Mimicry and Camouflage</h4>
<ul>
<li>Camouflage can be considered to be a form of mimicry where an insect uses a background or object, such as a leaf or a twig, as its model.</li>
<li>Batesian mimicry: where a harmless mimic poses as harmful</li>
<li>Mullerian mimicry: where two or more harmful species mutually advertise themselves as harmful</li>
</ul>
