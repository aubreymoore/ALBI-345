<li>Yesterday morning on my walk to Tagachang Beach, I passed a chicken recently killed on the road. It was swarming with caliphorid flies. This morning. The chicken was crawling with ants and there were very few flies. Are the ants less likely to land on a cadaver after it has been discovered by ants?</li>
<li>Pick a plant species and find all insects associated with it.</li>
<li>What species insects are found in mud nests? For each nest, determine the species of the mud dauber, the prey items, and parasitoids.</li>
<li>Are there fewer flying insect on the windward side of the island than the leeward side?</li>
<li>Insects visiting extrafloral nectaries</li>
