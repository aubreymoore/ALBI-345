<h2>Exponential Growth Model</h2>
<ul>
<li>Also referred to as the Malthusian growth model. Thomas Malthus introduced this model in <em>An Essay on the Principle of Population</em> published in 1798.</li>
<li>The exponential growth model assumes unlimited resources such as food and space.</li>
</ul>
<p>dN/dt = rN</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>r is the intrinsic growth rate: (births - deaths)/N</li>
<li>N is the population size</li>
</ul>

<h2>Logistic Growth Model</h2>
<ul>
<li>Also referred to as the Verhulst growth model. This model was developed by Pierre Verhulst in 1838, after he had read Malthus' essay.</li>
<li>The logistic model assumes that resource availability limits the number of individuals in a population to constant K, the <strong>carrying capacity</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p>dN/dt = rN *(K-N)/K</p>
<p>where:</p>
<ul>
<li>r is the instrinsic growth rate</li>
<li>K is the carrying capacity, the maximum population size that can be sustained by the environment</li>
</ul>

<h2>r and K Selection</h2>
<ul>
<li>r selected organisms produce many offspring = a high reproduction rate (r)</li>
<li>K selected organisms produce few offspring, but put significant resources into ensuring their survival</li>
