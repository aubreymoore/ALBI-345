# Visit to UOG Insect Collection

# Basic Insect Collecting and Preservation Techniques
* Collecting equipment: nets, aspirators, killing jars
* Pinning equipment: collection box, pins, paper points, pinning blocks, glassine envelopes, spreading boards, moth balls, labels

# First Collecting Experience

Will collect one or two insects (adults only; no soft-bodied specimens), kill them, pin them, and label them.

# Using iNaturalist

We will use the [iNaturalist Insects of Micronesia project](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/insects-of-micronesia) to compile a catalog for our collections.
