# Topics Covered Since Exam 1

## Insect Ecology

#### Population Dynamics

* Exponential growth model - unlimited growth
* Logistic Growth Model - growth limited by resources (carrying capacity)

#### Predator-prey relationships and biological control

* Lotka-Volterra model of predator-prey populations
* Insect parasitoids
* Pest resurgence

#### Social Insects

* Characteristics of eusociality:
  * Reproductive division of labor (with or without sterile castes)
  * Overlapping generations
  * Cooperative care of young
* Hymenoptera and Isoptera include most social insects
* Advantages of insect sociality:

#### Pollination

* Evolution of flowers
* Honeybee waggle dance: communication of direction and distance

#### Mimicry and Camouflage

* Camouflage can be considered to be a form of mimicry where an insect uses a background or object, such as a leaf or a twig, as its model.
* Batesian mimicry: where a harmless mimic poses as harmful
* Mullerian mimicry: where two or more harmful species mutually advertise themselves as harmful

## Invasive Species

* Definition of an invasive Species
* Why are tropical islands so susceptible to damage by invasive species?
* Pathways
* Why do so many invasive insects belong to Hemiptera?
* Response to invasive insects
