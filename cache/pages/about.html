<h1>Reusing Posts from the F2015 Pelican Site</h1>
<p>Since the previous web site was written using Pelican, it was convenient to use
the Markdown metedata format. To enable this, I added <strong>markdown.extensions.meta</strong>
to <strong>conf.py</strong>:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
# What Markdown extensions to enable?
# You will also get gist, nikola and podcast because those are
# done in the code, hope you don't mind ;-)
# Note: most Nikola-specific extensions are done via the Nikola plugin system,
#       with the MarkdownExtension class and should not be added here.
# The default is ['fenced_code', 'codehilite']
MARKDOWN_EXTENSIONS = [
    'markdown.extensions.fenced_code',
    'markdown.extensions.codehilite',
    'markdown.extensions.extra',
    'markdown.extensions.meta'
]

<h1>Scheduling</h1>
<p><strong>calendar.csv</strong> contains a list of dates and times for lectures and labs in a
format that can be imported into Google calendars. Start dates and times are
included in the metadata for each lecture and lab.</p>
