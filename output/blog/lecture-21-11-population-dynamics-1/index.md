## Exponential Growth Model

* Also referred to as the Malthusian growth model. Thomas Malthus introduced this model in *An Essay on the Principle of Population* published in 1798.
* The exponential growth model assumes unlimited resources such as food and space.

dN/dt = rN

where:

*  r is the intrinsic growth rate: (births - deaths)/N
*  N is the population size

## Logistic Growth Model

* Also referred to as the Verhulst growth model. This model was developed by Pierre Verhulst in 1838, after he had read Malthus' essay.
* The logistic model assumes that resource availability limits the number of individuals in a population to constant K, the **carrying capacity**.

dN/dt = rN *(K-N)/K

where:

* r is the instrinsic growth rate
* K is the carrying capacity, the maximum population size that can be sustained by the environment

## r and K Selection

* r selected organisms produce many offspring = a high reproduction rate (r)
* K selected organisms produce few offspring, but put significant resources into ensuring their survival
