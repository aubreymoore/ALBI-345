In this lecture period, we model population dynamics of the coconut rhinoceros
beetle using the exponential population growth model and the logistic population
growth model.

The mathematical models are expressed in Python code in a Jupyter notebook so
that we can play simulate CRB population growth.

## Lotka-Volterra Model of Interspecific Competition

The Lotka-Volterra model is used to calculate changes in the populations of two interacting populations
such as a predator and its prey, or an insect and its parasitoid.

[An interactive Jupyter notebook which explores the Lotka-Volterra model is available here.](https://notebooks.azure.com/n/fTohfbbUNNs/notebooks/Lotka-Volterra-Model.ipynb)
